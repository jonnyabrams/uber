# Ubre

An Uber clone (pronounced 'Ooh-bray') using React Native, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Google Maps API, Google Places Autocomplete and Google Distance Matrix.

Users can select an origin and a destination, both with autocomplete inputs, before being taken to a screen showing the directions on a map with a choice of rides to select from.

A dynamically calculated distance, time and price are all displayed thanks to the Google Distance Matrix API.
